<h1>City Search</h1>
<p>A demo of using the google maps API and using Angular, and Angular Materials</p>
<br />
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>This is familiarize myself more with working with APIs. Google Maps is a very common one. I wanted the following to be in my basic feature.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Place markers at the city locations</li>
	<li>Have a list displayed for the user to select from</li>
</ul>
<p>This gives me a very basic layout and something to build from. The ultimate goal should include the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A clean layout with wrappers</li>
	<li>An autocomplete search bar</li>
	<li>A confined list for the items</li>
	<li>those items, when clicked, display info and have marker be zoomed in</li>
</ul>
<br />
<h3>Problems and My Solutions</h3>
<p>I ran into a number of problems and found solutions for these. Some were very simple, other required some thought.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Annoying Angular script showing when connection is slow
		<ul>
			<li>It would appear when I kept refreshing the page. I researched the docs and discovered ng-cloak. Brilliant and straight-forward.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<ul>
			<li></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
